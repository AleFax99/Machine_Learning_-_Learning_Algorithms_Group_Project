# Data preprocessing 

## Checklist:

1) Split the data: 
  - Take the full-year enrollments for the training: Option 2 for censoring
  - Assessment: before March 15th 
  - Downsample to ensure that enrolled = not enrolled
2) data exploration:
  - pipeline
  - watch out for bias
3) Choose assessment metrics:
  - 1) Accuracy; but collect Sens and Spec.  
  BACKUP:
  - Firstly: Sensitivity to make sure that classrooms are not overcrowded
  - Secondly: Specificity to make sure that classrooms are not empty 
  - Thirdly: we care about Area Under the Curve to compare the prediction performace 
## Splitting data:

Load packages:
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(corrplot)
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)
```

Loading the data:
```{r}
load("offers_censored.RData")
source("./helpful_functions.R")
```

```{r}
 years_and_max_dates <- function(x) {
  x |>
    group_by(AppYear) |>
    summarise(
      `Num observations` = n(),
      `Max \`AppDate\`` = max(AppDate),
      `Max \`OfferDate\`` = max(OfferDate),
      `Max \`ResponseDate\`` = max(ResponseDate, na.rm = TRUE),
      `\`ResponseDate\` is NA` = sum(is.na(ResponseDate))
    )
 }
#lol
```


Making the splits according to Cesnoring 2 chosen:

```{r}
final_training_prediction_split <-
  offers |>
  filter(AppYear >= 2021) |>
  make_appyear_split(test_year = 2023)


```

The table below confirms that the final training set includes only data from 2021 and 2022, with no censoring:

```{r}
training(final_training_prediction_split) |> years_and_max_dates()
```
Next, create the analysis/assessment split:

```{r}
analysis_assessment_split <-
  offers |>
  # do not include 2020 in the analysis
  filter(AppYear >= 2021 & AppYear <= 2022) |>
  censor_post_prediction_responses(years = 2022) |>
  drop_post_prediction_offers(years = 2022) |>
  make_appyear_split(test_year = 2022)

```

The table below confirms that the analysis set includes only data from AY2021, and in each year, only contains information available before March 15.

```{r}
RSM_train <- training(analysis_assessment_split)
training(analysis_assessment_split) |> years_and_max_dates()
```
```{r}
RSM_test <- testing(analysis_assessment_split)
testing(analysis_assessment_split) |> years_and_max_dates()

```
Checking for class imbalance: There is slight class imbalance present, however there are enough observations for the algorithms to be able to distinguish between the two classes. 

```{r}
RSM_train %>% 
  count(Status) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))


```


## Preparing data for 5-fold CV:

```{r}
set.seed(616115436) # Call me xoxo

cv_folds <- vfold_cv(RSM_train, v = 5, strata = Status)
cv_folds
cv_folds$splits[[1]]

```

## Data exploration:

Here we provide the useful data exploration, however due to choosing CV, we cannot perform feature selection due to risk of introducing bias.
There are no missing values, except for the ResponseDate variable, which makes sense, as some of the students applying may not have inserted a response at all. 

```{r}
RSM_train |>
  skimr::skim()

```
Here we can see that all programmes have more "Enrolled" students than not enrolled, except for MiM master. 
```{r}
RSM_train %>% 
  ggplot() + aes(Program) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Status), position = "dodge")
  
```

Is seems that almost all of the students who have indicated to Accept the offer, indeed enrolled at RSM. Only ~4% who accepted did not enroll. 
```{r}
RSM_train %>% 
  ggplot() + aes(Response) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Status), position = "dodge")
  
```

```{r}
RSM_train %>% 
  filter(Response == "Accepted") %>% 
  group_by(Status) %>% 
  count()

89 / (1955 + 89)
```

Demo3 variable: 
```{r}
RSM_train %>% 
  ggplot() + aes(Demo3) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Status), position = "dodge")

```

The distribution of the applicaton date is irregular. It seems that the enrlollment patterns come in three waves. 
```{r}
RSM_train %>% 
  ggplot() + aes(AppDate) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Status)) 
```
